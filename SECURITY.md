# Security Policy

If a vulnerability is detected, please join the Discord server and create a ticket. Tickets are
private meaning other people will not be able to see the vulnerability and abuse it. We thank you
for creating tickets to report these vulnerabilities to us as we are able to detect any possible
flaws within the libraries we are using. As a reminder, the Discord server can be joined by clicking
on the "Chat" badge on the README.md.
